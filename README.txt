Problem description: write a chat client and server in racket

Grouping: Teams of 4. Divide work evenly. 

Combine your work in a shared git repository.

1) Working together, figure out the basic way that the "app" will work.
** Use stories: what do you do, what do you see?
Be specific and write it down.

2) More details. Make sure you have written the use stories first.
- Messages and their content
- Responses to messages
- Client model
- Universe model

3) Client
Decisions to make:
how many lines of text are you going to display
how will you display the text
how will the user type their message
how will the user send their message
** What will the client's model be? **

4) Server
Get your server responding to connection requests early so the client can run.
